Simple use of a topological sort. First create a dictionary then determine order.


## Description
You suddenly have a curious aspiration to create a package installer that can handle dependencies. You want to be able to give the installer a list of packages with dependencies, and have it install the packages in order such that an install wonâ€™t fail due to a missing dependency.
This exercise is to write the code that will determine the order of install.
